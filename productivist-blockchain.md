## Designing a blockchain architecture with Hyperledger

### Hyperledger overview

  * Multiple blockchains channels on the same fabric
  * Applications and smart-contracts
  * Organizations and Certificate Authorities
  
### The Productivist core blockchain

As described in the Productivist whitepaper, the blockchain implements a layered architecture. 

  * The public blockchain brings together all users, designers and builders on a common channel
  * Tokenization enables commercial uses, with no exposure to crypto-currencies fluctuations
  * Private solutions for specific production eco-systems are insulated their own blockchain channels


## Productivist blockchain applications

Smart-contracts running on the productivist blockchain will enable a variety of applications, providing different services.

### Core applications

These are the smart-contracts and applications provided by the Productivist organization. Transparent, open-source, they are the backbone of the Productivist service.

  * Tokenized service marketplace
  * Pre-production 3D model authentication
  * Post-production object certification

### User applications

Customers running their own blockchain channels have the ability to deploy specific applications at will.
